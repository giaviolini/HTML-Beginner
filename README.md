# HTML-Beginner
A beginning HTML site.
Assignment 1 of 10

This is the first website I created for my Basic HTML/CSS class at HACC. It uses the following HTML tags:

```<Head> ... </Head>``` Is where the heading information goes.

```<p> ... </p>``` Is a paragraph of text.

```<image> ... </image>``` Is an image tage and displays a picture in the browser.

```<hr>``` Displays a rule and is used to separate content on the webpage. It is a self-closing tag, meaning only one is used when writing the code.
