<hr>
<p>Hello! My name is Gia Violini. I wanted to start pursuing web design as a career to fit with the ever changing makeup of technology. Websites are always in demand, and if I know how to make them, it would make me in demand as well</p>
<hr>
<p>When I am not in school, I enjoy other creative outlets like drawing and dancing. I’ve always liked to draw and design things. Recently I helped out a local theatre create their playbill for their spring production of Songebob the Musical. It was definitely and interesting and overwhelming experience, but one I will continue to do this year as well.</p>
<p>I’ve been dancing since I was three years old, and since then I’ve never stoped. I enjoy the storytelling aspect of dancing. Ballets are unique ways to tell stories of love, heartbreak and revenge. I have danced in many styles, though my favoriate are ballet and lyrical. Though they can be seen has very similar, ballet allows me to get lost in the technicalities and ridgeness of it all, while lyrical allows me to be more fluid and flowing with my movement. </p>
<p>I also enjoy playing video games. Some of my favorites are…
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Animal Crossing</li>
    <li>The Sims 4</li>
    <li>Minecraft (nothing beats a minecraft phase)</li>
    <li>Ooblets</li>
    <li>Any Papa’s Game </li>
    <li> Stardew Valley</li>
  </ul>
<p>I find videos game an easy way to unwind, though sometimes it can also be stressful playing the game.</p>
<p>I also enjoy listening to music. Though my spotify wrapped minutes is not nearly as high as some of friends, I say it’s because I use different apps for music, Spotifty and Youtube Music. Lately I have been into two artists that I have had everything they have made on repeat. I’ve been listening to Renne Rap and CIL. Though combined they have a total of 20 songs, I think I could recite each song word for word.
